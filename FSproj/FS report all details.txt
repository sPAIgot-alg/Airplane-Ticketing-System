The provided code seems to be a part of an airline ticket management system. It includes functions for deleting a ticket (`DelTicket()`) and displaying the main menu (`Display()`), as well as functions for user login (`Login()`) and user registration (`Registration()`). However, the code provided is incomplete, as some portions are missing.

Here is a breakdown of the provided functions:

1. `DelTicket()`: This function is used to delete a ticket from the booking details. It prompts the user to enter the serial number of the ticket they want to delete, checks if the serial number exists in the records, and then deletes the corresponding ticket information from the file.

2. `Display(int c)`: This function displays the main menu of the airline ticket management system. It uses a do-while loop to repeatedly display the menu options and execute the corresponding actions based on the user's choice. The function calls other functions like `NewTicket()`, `EditTicket()`, `DelTicket()`, `printTic()`, and `LuggageDetails()` based on the user's selection.

3. `Login(int c)`: This function is used for user login. It reads login details from a file, prompts the user to enter their username and password, and verifies the credentials. If the credentials match, the user is logged in, and the `Display()` function is called to show the main menu.

4. `Registration(int c)`: This function is used for user registration. It prompts the user to enter their username and email address, performs validation checks on the input, and stores the registration details in a file.

It's worth noting that the code provided is incomplete and lacks necessary declarations, such as the definition of the `User` struct and the initialization of the `AllTickets` array used in `DelTicket()`. Additionally, the code may have some logical errors or missing parts that could affect its functionality.





Certainly! The code you provided appears to be a part of an airline ticket management system. Let's go through it step by step to understand its functionality.

The code snippet you shared includes three functions: `DelTicket()`, `Display()`, and `Login()`. It seems to be a part of a larger program that handles user registration, login, ticket creation, editing, deletion, and display.

1. `DelTicket()`: This function is responsible for deleting a ticket based on the provided serial number. Here's a breakdown of its key steps:
   - It initializes variables and opens the file "Booking_Details.txt" to count the number of previously recorded lines (bookings).
   - It prompts the user to enter the serial number of the booking they want to delete.
   - It iterates through the bookings to find a match with the entered serial number.
   - If a match is found, the corresponding booking information is cleared by assigning empty values to the respective struct fields.
   - If the serial number is not found, it displays a message and prompts the user again.
   - It then opens the "Booking_Details.txt" file, truncates its content (deletes everything), and rewrites the remaining bookings (excluding the deleted one) to the file.
   - Finally, it displays a success message.

2. `Display(int c)`: This function represents the main menu of the program, where users can choose various options. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:
   - It clears the console and displays the main menu options.
   - It waits for user input and executes the corresponding option:
     - Option 1: Calls the `NewTicket(c)` function to create a new ticket.
     - Option 2: Calls the `EditTicket()` function to edit an existing ticket.
     - Option 3: Calls the `DelTicket()` function to delete a ticket.
     - Option 4: Calls the `printTic(Counter)` function to print or display the booked tickets.
     - Option 5: Calls the `LuggageDetails()` function to display luggage allowance details.
     - Option 6: Displays an exit message and breaks the loop, effectively exiting the program.

3. `Login(int c)`: This function handles the login process for the users. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:
   - It reads the login details from the "Login_Details.txt" file and stores them in an array of `User` structs.
   - It prompts the user to enter their username and password.
   - It compares the entered username and password with the stored login details to determine if the login is valid.
   - If the login is successful, it displays a success message, waits for a few seconds, and then calls the `Display(c)` function to show the main menu.
   - If the login fails, it displays an error message, clears the entered username and password, and prompts the user to try again.

In addition to the functions you provided, there might be other functions (not included in the snippet) that handle ticket creation, editing, printing, and other aspects of the airline ticket management system.

Please note that the provided code snippet is not complete and doesn't include the complete implementation of the mentioned functions.

Data Structures used 
In the provided code of the airline ticketing system, several data structures are used:

1. Structs: The code defines a struct called `User` to represent login details, and another struct called `Booking` to represent ticket booking details. Structs are used to group related data together.

2. Arrays: The code uses arrays to store multiple instances of the `User` struct. The `User` array holds the login details of multiple users.

3. File I/O: The code reads data from and writes data to text files ("Login_Details.txt" and "Booking_Details.txt"). The file structure is used to store and retrieve login details and booking information.

Overall, the code primarily relies on arrays and file I/O for storing and managing data in the airline ticketing system.

In conclusion, the project demonstrates a simple implementation of a ticket booking system. It allows users to register, login, and create tickets for various destinations. The project emphasizes user authentication and provides a basic interface for managing tickets.

Throughout the implementation, the project covers essential programming concepts such as file handling, user input validation, and data storage. It showcases the use of file operations to store and retrieve user login details and ticket information.

However, it's important to note that the provided code and algorithm represent a simplified version of a ticket booking system. In real-world scenarios, additional features like ticket availability checks, seat selection algorithms, and payment integrations would be necessary. Furthermore, robust error handling, data validation, and security measures would need to be implemented for a production-grade application.

Overall, this project serves as a starting point for building a more comprehensive and sophisticated ticket booking system, providing a foundation for further enhancements and customization based on specific requirements.



Email Notifications: Adding an email notification system would keep users informed about their bookings, including confirmation emails, reminders, and updates. This feature would improve communication with users and provide them with important information regarding their reservations.

Booking History and User Profiles: Creating a booking history for each user would allow them to view their past reservations and easily track their travel history. Additionally, implementing user profiles would enable users to manage their personal information, preferences, and notification settings.

Social Media Integration: Integrating social media features would allow users to share their ticket bookings or invite friends to join them. This could help increase the system's visibility and attract new users through word-of-mouth referrals.

Multilingual Support: Adding multilingual support would make the ticket booking system accessible to users from different regions and language backgrounds. It would enhance the user experience and make the application more inclusive.
